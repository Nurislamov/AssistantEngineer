## GREE-ALICE current checkpoint

### Current stage

GREE-ALICE-06 — CLOSED / pushed.

Latest commit:

`	ext
62e7f646 GREE-ALICE-06 Add read-only live status probe
`

### Completed stages

`	ext
GREE-ALICE-00 — CLOSED / pushed — bridge placement decision
GREE-ALICE-01 — CLOSED / pushed — cloud probe plan
GREE-ALICE-02 — CLOSED / pushed — Gree Cloud probe tool scaffold
GREE-ALICE-03 — CLOSED / pushed — Gree+ Cloud login and discovery
GREE-ALICE-04 — CLOSED / pushed — normalized Gree Cloud device snapshot
GREE-ALICE-05 — CLOSED / pushed — safe raw cloud properties snapshot
GREE-ALICE-06 — CLOSED / pushed — read-only live status probe
`

### Validation status

`	ext
dotnet test .\AssistantEngineer.sln --no-build
Result: PASS
Tests: 5411/5411
`

### Cloud validation

`	ext
Gree+ Cloud login: PASS
Region shown by app/account: Ouzbekistan / Ouzbékistan
Validated server: https://hkgrih.gree.com
Homes: 1
Rooms: 1
Devices: 1
Device: AC3167
Device version: V3.4.M
Device key: provided
Sensitive fields: masked in reports
`

### Device classification

`	ext
Cloud classification: vrf-child-unit-candidate
Normalized kind: gree-vrf-child-unit
Candidate control target: room-climate-unit
`

### GREE-ALICE-06 findings

`	ext
Read-only live status probe tool: implemented
Live probe login/discovery: PASS
Candidate REST endpoints attempted: 32
Result: all attempted /App/Get... live-status endpoints returned HTTP 404
Live capability fields found: none
Missing fields: Pow / Mod / SetTem / WdSpd / temperature / fan / swing
`

Conclusion:

`	ext
GetDevsInRoomsOfHomeV2 provides metadata only.
Live status/control is not exposed through the simple /App/GetDeviceStatus / GetDevStatus / GetDevAttrs style endpoints on hkgrih.gree.com.
Next step is to find the actual Gree+ live/control channel.
`

### Important decisions

`	ext
Keep GREE-ALICE isolated in tools/AssistantEngineer.Tools.GreeCloudProbe for now.
Do not wire into AssistantEngineer.Api, Telegram, deployment, migrations, or runtime config yet.
Do not commit local artifacts under artifacts/gree-alice/.
Do not store Gree+ credentials in files or repository.
Use masked reports only.
Control commands are still out of scope until live-status/control channel is confirmed.

### Next step

GREE-ALICE-07 — Find actual live/control channel.

Planned scope:

`	ext
- stop guessing simple /App/Get... live endpoints;
- investigate actual channel used by Gree+ for live status/control;
- look for MQTT/WebSocket/IoT endpoint candidates;
- prepare safe traffic-capture workflow for Gree+ app without storing passwords;
- keep all actions read-only until the real status/control protocol is known.

## Current stage

ED-24BOT.CORE1 — CLOSED / production PASS.

Bot architecture audit and first behavior-preserving channel-neutral diagnostic core extraction are merged to master and deployed to production.

Production context:

```text
PR: #60
Merge commit: 52ca74a8
Audit commit: 2a056480
Core extraction commit: 118009fc
State checkpoint commit before production smoke: d4437864
VPS deployed commit: 52ca74a8
```
## Current branch

master
## Last completed work

### ED-24BOT.AUDIT1

ED-24BOT.AUDIT1 is closed.

The architecture audit documented the current Telegram bot / equipment diagnostics flow, identified channel-neutral diagnostic core boundaries, Telegram adapter boundaries, web-reuse candidates, missing tests, and production risks.

Audit report:

### ED-24BOT.CORE1

ED-24BOT.CORE1 is closed and production-smoked.

Implementation commit:

```text
118009fc ED-24BOT.CORE1 Extract channel-neutral diagnostic core
```

State checkpoint commit:

```text
d4437864 ED-24BOT.CORE1 Update project state
```

Merge commit:

```text
52ca74a8 Merge pull request #60 from Nurislamov/ed-24bot-architecture-core
```

Implemented first behavior-preserving channel-neutral diagnostic core slice:

```text
- added neutral IEquipmentDiagnosticCore;
- added EquipmentDiagnosticCore and internal EquipmentDiagnosticCoreEngine;
- added DiagnosticCoreRequest / DiagnosticCoreResult and neutral diagnostic contracts;
- added neutral identity, ambiguity, audience, guidance, source and safety contracts;
- added EquipmentDiagnosticBotCompatibilityMapper;
- EquipmentDiagnosticBotService now delegates through the compatibility adapter;
- existing /api/v1/equipment-diagnostics/bot/diagnose route and bot DTO JSON shape preserved;
- no new public endpoint added;
- no Telegram runtime files changed.
```

Production deploy:

## Current blocker

None.

ED-24BOT.CORE1 is production PASS.
## Important decisions

CORE1 is compatibility-first.

Existing `/api/v1/equipment-diagnostics/bot/diagnose` route and bot DTO JSON contracts must remain stable.

Telegram runtime code was intentionally not changed in CORE1.

Manual library, service requests, Telegram history extraction, parser delegation, and web API work remain out of scope for CORE1.

The internal core engine still reuses legacy bot semantic types to guarantee exact first-slice compatibility. Deeper cleanup must be a separately reviewed stage.

Do not use `docker compose --remove-orphans` on production automatically. The healthy `assistantengineer-postgres-1` orphan warning is known and treated as production data-bearing infrastructure unless separately reviewed.

Telegram polling batch failed: not observed
error/exception: not observed
duplicate skipped: not observed
```

Visual Telegram smoke: PASS.
## Known backlog

CI maintenance:

- Node.js 20 deprecation warning remains future maintenance.

Flaky/infrastructure watch:

- SQLite idempotency integration test has historical flakiness:
  - EngineeringWorkflowSqliteProviderPersistsIdempotencyAcrossFactoryRestart

## Next step

Recommended next stage:

```text
ED-24BOT.CORE2 or ED-24BOT.CORE1.POST — small follow-up only after separate review
```

Possible follow-ups, do not start automatically:

```text
- reduce internal dependency of EquipmentDiagnosticCoreEngine on legacy bot semantic types;
- add neutral diagnostic text interpreter only after separate parser-delegation stage;
- design neutral history event projection only after separate history stage;
- keep MANUAL1, REQUEST1 and WEB1 out of scope until separately planned.
```
