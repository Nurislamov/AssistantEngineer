# AssistantEngineer Project State

## Current stage

ED-24OPS.2a - CLOSED / pushed.

Next recommended steps:

1. Deploy ED-24OPS.2a when ready to enable Telegram video note support in the production operator inbox.
2. Keep the ED-24QA.1 quality baseline and ED-24OPS.1 local smoke runner green.
3. Use `.\scripts\diagnostics\run-gree-diagnostics-smoke.ps1` before deploy or after Gree diagnostics changes.

## Current branch

master

## Last completed work

ED-24OPS.2a adds Telegram `video_note` / "circle" support to the operator inbox, including webhook parsing, `VideoNote` message kind persistence, safe `[Видео-кружок]` operator cards, internal `copyMessage` mirroring, and Owner text replies to both the card and copied media.

Previous implementation commit: `ec553a8a` (ED-24OPS.2).

## Validation status

ED-24OPS.1 local smoke runner:

`.\scripts\diagnostics\run-gree-diagnostics-smoke.ps1`

ED-24OPS.1 smoke:

9/9 passed

Full baseline after ED-24OPS.1:

4922/4922 passed

Latest validation after ED-24OPS.2:

- Telegram operator inbox added behind `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_INBOX_ENABLED`, `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_CHAT_ID`, and `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_LOG_DIAGNOSTICS`; docker compose, `.env.example`, deployment validators, and environment docs are updated.
- `/operator_chat_id` works only for the linked Owner in a Telegram group/supergroup and reports the chat id needed for `TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_CHAT_ID`.
- User fallback/support messages are mirrored to the configured operator group as safe request cards; normal commands, default diagnostics, and manual/library protected content are not mirrored.
- Media mirroring uses Telegram `copyMessage` only from the user chat to the configured operator group and does not expose `file_id`, `file_unique_id`, source references, or secrets in cards.
- Owner reply bridge sends text replies only when the Owner replies to a mirrored request card/message in the configured operator group; non-owner replies, unknown reply targets, and non-text replies are blocked with safe messages.
- EF migration `20260629193430_AddTelegramOperatorInbox` adds `TelegramOperatorInboxThreads` and `TelegramOperatorInboxMessages` with lookup indexes for operator/user reply routing.
- Library access-request empty state now has a working Back button to the library root.
- Validation: `dotnet restore .\AssistantEngineer.sln` passed; `dotnet build .\AssistantEngineer.sln` passed with 0 warnings/errors; focused Telegram/operator/library/persistence tests passed 787/787; operator-only tests passed 8/8; deployment scaffold validator passed; production-env placeholder validator passed; local Gree diagnostics smoke passed 9/9; full solution test suite passed 4982/4982; `git diff --check` passed.
- Runtime total: 922 confirmed by counting `data/equipment-diagnostics/error-knowledge/gree/**/*.json`.
- Runtime JSON cards, diagnostic codes, source references, and routing unchanged.

Latest validation after ED-24OPS.2a:

- Telegram `video_note` is accepted by webhook/polling contracts with Telegram API metadata fields parsed but not logged or exposed.
- Operator inbox classifies the attachment as `VideoNote`; no migration was added because `MessageKind` is stored as a string.
- Private user video notes create/reuse inbox threads, send a safe operator card with `[Видео-кружок]`, and mirror the media to the configured operator group through the existing internal `copyMessage` path.
- Successfully mirrored video notes return `Сообщение передано специалисту.` to the user instead of the old unsupported text/contact fallback.
- Owner text reply bridge works when replying to either the video-note operator card or the copied video-note media message; owner media replies remain unsupported.
- `forwardMessage` remains unused; `copyMessage` remains internal operator media mirroring only; library/manual delivery to users still uses protected `sendDocument(file_id)`.
- Service manuals remain library-only, and the diagnostic Owner/User manual-only policy is unchanged.
- Restore: PASS.
- Build: PASS, 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Focused Operator/Inbox/Webhook/Telegram/Library/Manual/Persistence tests: 843/843 passed.
- Local Gree diagnostics smoke: 9/9 passed.

- Gree technical diagnostic answers, n2 ambiguity, and explicit-series not-found use safe escaped HTML with `ParseMode: HTML`.
- The service-request button is `🛠 Оставить заявку`; the previous label remains accepted as a legacy input alias.
- The repetitive `Дальше:` block is absent from found Gree Telegram answers.
- `Ограничения вывода:` is replaced by `Ограничения:`.
- Local Gree diagnostics smoke: 9/9 passed.
- EquipmentDiagnostics tests: 940/940 passed.
- Full solution baseline: 4924/4924 passed.

- Found Gree `Что проверить:` sections use three short, non-duplicating bullets.
- Fault/protection-style answers confirm code, series, and indication location, then separate model and occurrence-context checks.
- Status/service-function answers confirm code, signal category, and display location, then separate model, settings, and related-message checks.
- Grouped answers retain a neutral reference to the service procedure in the applicable-series manual.
- Separate `Техническая заметка:`, `Ограничения:`, and `Дальше:` blocks remain absent.

Latest validation after ED-24SRC.1:

- Concrete found Gree diagnostics show `📄 Мануал` only to Installer, Engineer, Admin, and Owner roles.
- Consumer users do not see the action; manually submitted text/callback actions are denied before manual metadata is resolved.
- Not-found, ambiguity, non-Gree, and non-concrete diagnostic states do not expose the contextual manual action.
- The action uses the existing latest completed diagnostic history and requires the same manufacturer, concrete series, and code.
- Existing reviewed Telegram `file_id` bindings are delivered through `sendDocument`.
- `copyMessage` remains reserved for future reviewed source chat/message metadata; no fake identifiers were added.
- `forwardMessage` is intentionally not used.

- EquipmentDiagnostics tests: 949/949 passed.
- Local Gree diagnostics smoke: 9/9 passed.
- Full solution baseline: 4933/4933 passed.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Runtime total: 922.
- Runtime JSON cards, diagnostic codes, source references, and routing unchanged.

Latest validation after ED-24USR.2:

- Telegram admin callback actor resolution now checks Telegram user id first, then safely falls back to the private chat stored user record when identity was not backfilled yet.
- Private chat fallback backfills Telegram identity details through the existing user store path.
- Owner/Admin user-card callbacks from `/admin_users`, including `Открыть: <user>`, should no longer fall into `Нет доступа` when the manager record was created by chat id/bootstrap with missing `TelegramUserId`.
- Duplicate Telegram identity risk is covered: if `TelegramUserId` lookup finds a non-manager duplicate, a private-chat Owner/Admin record remains authoritative for that private callback.
- Group callbacks do not inherit permissions from group chat id fallback.
- ED-24SRC.1 manual access gating is preserved: focused `EquipmentDiagnosticTelegramManualLibraryTests` passed as part of validation.
- Restore: PASS.
- Build: PASS, 6 existing nullable warnings in unrelated architecture tests / 0 errors.
- Focused Telegram admin/manual/adapter tests: 131/131 passed.

- Technical manual button: PASS; after `Gree GMV9 Flex E0`, diagnostics are shown with contextual `📄 Мануал` and without `📘 Руководства`.
- Manual not-linked fallback keyboard retention: PASS; pressing `📄 Мануал` shows `Мануал пока не привязан`, includes `Gree GMV9 Flex / E0`, keeps contextual `📄 Мануал`, and does not restore `📘 Руководства`.
- Telegram reply keyboard no longer exposes the global `📘 Руководства` button.
- `📄 Мануал` remains the only contextual manual action.
- Compact keyboard layout confirmed in production:
  - Consumer rows: `🔎 Новый код` / `📋 История`, then `🛠 Оставить заявку` / `📄 Мои заявки`.
  - Technical rows: `🔎 Новый код` / `📄 Мануал`, then `📋 История` / `🛠 Оставить заявку`, then `📄 Мои заявки`.
- Polling logs: clean; container logs showed command menu sync, polling start, successful `deleteWebhook`, `Sending Telegram response`, processed updates, and `Status: Processed` with no `error`, `exception`, or `failed` entries.
- ED-24SRC.1 manual access gating is preserved: consumers are still denied, technical roles retain contextual access only.
- ED-24USR.2 production behavior was confirmed during the same live-check through role switching/admin UI.
- Runtime total: 922.
- Runtime JSON cards, diagnostic cards, diagnostic codes, sourceReferences, and routing unchanged.

Latest local validation after ED-24SRC.1a:

- Telegram reply keyboard no longer exposes the global `📘 Руководства` button.
- Technical concrete found Gree diagnostics now show only contextual `📄 Мануал` with compact rows: `🔎 Новый код` / `📄 Мануал`, then `📋 История` / `🛠 Оставить заявку`, then `📄 Мои заявки`.
- Consumer concrete found diagnostics use compact rows: `🔎 Новый код` / `📋 История`, then `🛠 Оставить заявку` / `📄 Мои заявки`; no manual actions or phone-row are shown on the diagnostic answer.
- Manual-not-linked replies preserve the contextual `📄 Мануал` keyboard while the last concrete diagnostic context remains valid.
- ED-24SRC.1 manual access gating is preserved: consumers are still denied, technical roles retain contextual access only.
- Restore: PASS.
- Build: PASS, 0 warnings / 0 errors.

Latest validation after ED-24USR.3:

- Implementation commit: `a33ea0ea`.
- Project-state commit before production pass: `4055d1ff`.
- Telegram user roles/access state now use the existing persistent EF Core `TelegramUsers` store in production/default infrastructure DI (`ITelegramUserStore` -> `EfTelegramUserStore`).
- Existing migrations cover the persistent state: `20260617062738_AddTelegramUsers` and `20260617120000_AddTelegramUserPhoneSource`.
- Persisted fields include role, enabled/blocked flags, Telegram identity fields, phone state/source, `LastSeenAt`, and `LastAccessDeniedAt`.
- Bootstrap owner by chat id remains supported and `GetOrCreateConsumerAsync` does not downgrade existing Owner/Admin/Engineer/Installer records.
- Duplicate Telegram identity handling is deterministic: active unblocked manager records are selected before consumer duplicates, preserving ED-24USR.2 admin callback actor resolution.
- Private-chat Owner/Admin fallback remains authoritative when a Telegram user id lookup hits a non-manager duplicate; group callbacks still do not inherit chat-id fallback permissions.
- ED-24SRC.1/ED-24SRC.1a manual access gating is preserved: consumers remain denied for `рџ“„ РњР°РЅСѓР°Р»`, technical roles retain the contextual manual action, and `рџ“ Р СѓРєРѕРІРѕРґСЃС‚РІР°` does not return.
- Existing in-memory role assignments from older container lifetimes do not auto-migrate; any missing production roles need one-time admin assignment and then persist in the database.

- Service/container `assistantengineer-api`: PASS; container restarted and application started successfully.
- PostgreSQL health: PASS.
- Telegram polling startup: PASS.
- Restart persistence check: PASS; technical role persisted after container restart/redeploy.
- Roles persistence after restart: PASS; the technical role still sees the contextual manual action after `Gree GMV9 Flex E0`.
- Manual gate after restart: PASS; consumers still do not see the contextual manual action, technical roles do, and the global guides action did not return.
- Compact Telegram keyboard layout remained confirmed after restart.
- Telegram polling logs: clean; observed `Telegram polling started`, `Application started`, `Telegram polling update processed`, and `Status: Processed` with no `error`, `exception`, or `failed` entries.
- Existing EF warning `HourlySchedule.Factors ... value converter but with no value comparer` was observed; it is unrelated to Telegram user persistence and does not block ED-24USR.3.
- Runtime total: 922.
- Runtime JSON cards, diagnostic cards, diagnostic codes, sourceReferences, routing, manual bindings, and deployment scripts unchanged.

Latest validation after ED-24LIB.1:

- ED-24LIB.1 status: CLOSED / pushed.

- Migration added: `20260629165833_AddTelegramFileLibrary`.
- `TelegramManualBindings` were extended with library/document classification fields for title, document type, minimum role, library visibility, and diagnostic eligibility.
- New persistent library access storage added through `TelegramLibraryAccessGrants` and `TelegramLibraryAccessRequests`.
- Owner has implicit full library access and is the only role that manages library grants/requests.
- Admin does not manage the library by default and needs an explicit Owner grant to use the library.
- Engineer and Installer library entry is both role-gated and Owner-grant-gated; Consumer users do not get library access.
- The `Library` button is shown only to active, unblocked users who satisfy role and grant requirements, while Owner always sees it.
- Every library action and callback re-checks role, active/blocked state, and library access grant before listing or sending files.
- Service manuals are library-only.
- Diagnostic context now only allows safe `OwnerManual` / `UserGuide` documents marked for diagnostics.
- Existing service manual bindings do not bypass the diagnostic policy and no longer satisfy diagnostic manual delivery by themselves.
- Protected delivery through `sendDocument(file_id)` with protected content is preserved.
- `forwardMessage` and `copyMessage` are not used.
- `/manual_bind` remains the file registration path and now creates service/library-only bindings by default.
- Restore: PASS.
- Build: PASS.
- Focused Telegram manual/library/user/persistence tests: PASS, 752/752 passed.
- Migration/DI/persistence validator slice: PASS.

Latest validation after ED-24LIB.1a:

- ED-24LIB.1a status: CLOSED / pushed.
- Fixed fresh Telegram library callback stale handling for library navigation, Gree, remotes, access management, access requests, back/cancel, and repeated library opens.
- Stable library navigation callbacks no longer depend on short-lived ephemeral state; the stale-action response is reserved for truly unknown or invalid callback payloads.
- Access request lists now show requester display name, username when available, role, and chat id instead of only `chat <id>`.
- Owner approve/reject actions notify the requester in private chat through bot `sendMessage`.
- Approve sends a refreshed main reply keyboard with the Library entry when the requester still has valid role, enabled/unblocked state, and active grant.
- Reject keeps the requester without the Library entry unless another active grant already allows access.
- Revoke/grant management paths refresh the target user's keyboard when a notification can be delivered.
- Owner-only approval is preserved; Admin cannot approve/reject or manage library access by default.
- Library actions still re-check user existence, active/enabled state, blocked state, role, Owner implicit access, explicit non-owner grant, file `MinRole`, `IsActive`, and `IsLibraryVisible`.
- Service manuals remain library-only.
- Diagnostic context remains limited to `OwnerManual` / `UserGuide` documents marked for diagnostics.
- Existing service manual bindings still do not bypass diagnostic policy.
- Protected delivery through `sendDocument(file_id)` with protected content is preserved.

Latest validation after ED-24LIB.1c:

- ED-24LIB.1c status: CLOSED / pushed.
- Telegram library callback navigation now edits the current inline message instead of creating a new text message for normal navigation.
- Initial library open from `/library` or the reply keyboard still sends one new message with the inline library menu.
- Owner and granted Engineer navigation through Gree, remotes, access requests, access management, back, cancel, repeated callbacks, file list, and empty sections no longer creates extra navigation sendMessages.
- File callbacks edit the current library message with a short sending status and then send the PDF/document separately through protected `sendDocument(file_id)`.

- Owner-only access management is preserved.
- Admin still cannot manage library access by default.

Latest validation after ED-24MAN.1:

- Implementation commit: `8a3edb6a`.
- ED-24MAN.1 status: CLOSED / production PASS.
- Admin/Owner `/manual_bind` flow added: choose Gree series, send PDF document to the bot, validate filename/series, confirm bind, and explicitly confirm replacement for an existing active series binding.
- Supported production series bindings: Gree GMV6, Gree GMV Mini, Gree GMV X, and Gree GMV9 Flex.
- Production manual bindings use existing EF Core persistence through `TelegramManualBindings` and migration `20260629042754_AddTelegramManualBindings`.
- Stored binding metadata includes Telegram `file_id`, optional `file_unique_id`, safe filename, content type, file size, uploader Telegram user/chat ids, registered role, source, timestamps, and active state.
- No local PDF archive/storage was added; real manual binaries and real Telegram file ids remain out of source control.
- Diagnostic `📄 Мануал` delivery now resolves the latest completed Gree diagnostic series and sends the bound document with `sendDocument(file_id)` and `protect_content=true`.
- `forwardMessage` and `copyMessage` are not used.
- Consumers remain denied; Installer/Engineer/Admin/Owner can receive contextual diagnostic manuals when a binding exists.

## Important product decisions

- Do not show document codes like GC202512-I / GC202209-I / GC202203-IV in Telegram visible diagnostic answers.
- Keep document/manual references only in metadata/sourceReferences.
- Later manuals should be delivered by a separate button/action, not by embedding document codes in every answer.
- Explicit series query must not fallback to other series.
- General Gree n2 must show only real series where n2 exists: GMV Mini, GMV6, GMV X.
- GMV9 Flex n2 must not be added unless runtime/manual confirms it.
- Keep visible answers readable Russian: no mixed translation, no question-mark placeholders.
- Guard grammar: no 'к наружного блока', no 'к внутреннего блока', no 'к наладки системы'.
- Do not give Codex prompts automatically before discussing the next stage.

## Future candidates

- ED-24MAN.2 - Manual taxonomy / owner vs service access levels.
- ED-24MAN.3 - Manual variants by model family / exact model matching.
- ED-24SRC.2 - Compare Mini manuals and decide Mini/Star/Slim handling.

## Current blocker

No active blocker after ED-24LIB.1c pushed.

## Next step

Discuss one of the next possible small follow-ups: ED-24MAN.2 manual taxonomy / owner vs service access levels, ED-24MAN.3 manual variants by model family / exact model matching, ED-24SRC.2 Mini manual comparison, EF enum sentinel warning hygiene, EF warning hygiene for HourlySchedule.Factors, or the next Gree diagnostics direction.
